# Numerical solution to the linear advection equation
Assignment of the course on Numerical Analysis by the MFC CDT.

This code solves numerically the linear advection equation through three finite difference methods:
* Forward in time backward in space (FTBS)
* Forward in time center in space (FTCS)
* Center in time center in space (CTCS).

To find the numerical solution to the linear advection equation, run the code AdvEq.py. Make sure that, in the folder where you're doing this, you also have the file advschemes.py (present in this repository), as it contains functions used by AdvEq.py.
