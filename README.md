# Numerical solutions to partial differential equations
Repository for the course on Numerical Analysis by the MFC CDT.

Folder "AssignmentPart1" contains my work for the first part of the assignment, with a code that solves numerically the constant-speed linear advection equation.

Folder "AssignmentPart2" containts the work for the second part, with a code that computes the pollutant spread over Reading from a fire in Southampton, in the static diffusive case (for now).

The rest of the repository contains excercises and extra codes.
